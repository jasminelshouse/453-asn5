Notes: 

Jasmine stopped on the assignment on Wednesday as I have no more late days, but 
continued to work with Kylie through her late days for personal understanding.   


We are having a lot of trouble with trying to figure out what went wrong in this
assignment regarding calculating the inodes and its offsets. We initally got
the superblock numbers for TestImage working with minls. However, we started
to run into issues with calculating inodes and direct zones. After working
through and figuring out the issue for TestImage, we moved onto working on
the HardDisk where we dealt with a partition and a subpartition. This threw us
for a loop. Nothing was lining up, so long story short, after a ton of debug 
statements and calculating we were able to line up the superblock contents and
the computed fields. But again, we ran into the issue of calculating the File
inode and direct zones. Because these weren't reading properly, we weren't able
to find the correct files in the partition to print out. 

We're stumped because we are 99.999% sure we're calculating our inode offsets
correctly, yet we aren't parsing the right raw inode data, hence our wrong file
inode and direct zones. 

These were the calculations we were doing to find our inode offset.

inode_offset = (inode_block * blocksize) + (inode_index * inode_size)
inode_offset = (179 * 4096) + ( 0 * 64)
inode_offset = 16384 

This did not bring us to find the correct file inode structure of the 
subpartition. We think it's due to not accurately accessing the subpartition,
and instead we're still trying to read stuff from the partition. However,
we checked our subpartition and even used -xxd to create a hex dump for blocks
of data to see if we were able to find the correct offset of the subpartition.

Update: We worked on it on Thursday because we knew we were super close to
figuring out what was wrong. We ended up working backwards and trying to 
fix the outputs of the Partition image as well as the other partition images
before going back to hard disk. One of the main reasons that caused a lot of 
issues was that we werent reading the partition offsets for the inodes. We 
ended up going back to an older version of our read_partition_table function
and it ended up working perfectly with both paritition and hard disk. 

We worked so hard on this assignment (our eyes are burning). 
We are both set to graduate this quarter so please be kind to us (lol jk, no 
actually really please be kind to us).
